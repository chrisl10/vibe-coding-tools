# Product Demo Stinger

Designed and built by Legion Code Inc.

## Purpose

Return an evidence-bound storyboard, tutorial, narration and caption draft, claim worksheet and production handoff for one buyer goal. Demonstrated claims must match the observed product revision and environment. This research-only skill returns text; an authorized orchestrator saves reports. It makes no application or media changes.

## When to use

- “Make an honest product demo or tutorial.”
- “Which features can we actually show in this walkthrough?”
- “Review this script for unsupported claims and missing failures.”

## When not to use

- Actual live capture, inventories and recording: selected webapp-capture-stinger in browser-and-app-testing-tools.
- Voice or avatar provider integration: selected elevenlabs-api-stinger or heygen-api-stinger.
- General marketing strategy, UI implementation or an invented customer story.

## Procedure

1. Read [README.md](README.md) and [Prove the story](guides/01-prove-the-story.md). Identify audience, goal, actual inputs and evidence gaps.
2. Fill the [claim worksheet](references/claim-to-scene-worksheet.md) with revision, source/test/capture locators and claim classification. UNKNOWN remains unknown.
3. Follow [Plan scenes and tutorial](guides/02-plan-scenes-and-tutorial.md), including material failure, focus explanation and visible mock/synthetic/time-edit disclosures.
4. Follow [Review and handoff](guides/03-review-and-handoff.md). Return the complete draft and six-field report under the proposed consumer Library location; writing orchestrator persists it.
5. Resolve selected existing production owners through Core before handoff. This packet grants no interaction, generation, upload or publication approval.

## References map

- [Reference map](references/REFERENCE.md): worksheets, example, review cases and exact archive.
- [Dated distillation](references/research/distilled-product-demo.md): validate domain claims and local policy boundaries.
- [Raw manifest](https://github.com/legioncodeinc/the-wasp-nest-source/blob/main/packs/media-and-creative-tools/skills/product-demo-stinger/references/research/raw/manifest.json): trace current official docs and source snapshots.
- [Paired Drone](../../agents/product-demo-wasp-drone.md): scoped read-only planning.

## Related drones and stingers

- [elevenlabs-api-stinger](../elevenlabs-api-stinger): selected voice integration owner.
- [heygen-api-stinger](../heygen-api-stinger): selected avatar/video integration owner.
- Resolve webapp-capture-stinger by its selected browser-and-app-testing-tools owner; do not presume cross-pack installation.

Research-only: no Ship Gate at runtime because this procedure produces planning/report text and changes no application code. Forging or promoting its repository source still requires Security, Quality and orchestrator repository health before a commit, with user review and approval.

## Critical Directive

- You must read all files and context contained within your skill.
- In the event your core knowledge does not provide sufficient guidance you must make every attempt to search the internet, related knowledge base documentation files, and other available resources to supplement your knowledge prior to proceeding with your task.
- Additional related skills can be found here:
  - [elevenlabs-api-stinger](../elevenlabs-api-stinger) - voice integration when selected and separately authorized.
  - [heygen-api-stinger](../heygen-api-stinger) - avatar/video integration when selected and separately authorized.
