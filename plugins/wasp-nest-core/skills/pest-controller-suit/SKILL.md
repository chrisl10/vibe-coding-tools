# Pest-Controller-Suit

Start with [README.md](README.md) for the workflow map and detailed references.

Pest Controller-suit is the routing skill for The Wasp Nest, the agentic development system distributed by Vibe Coding Tools. The Wasp Nest works across Claude Code, Cursor, ChatGPT Codex, and Claude Cowork. It is built from Drones (subagents, one per domain) and Stingers (the paired skill each Drone reads before it touches anything). Pest Controller-suit does not do the work itself. Given a request, it names the Drone that owns it, makes sure that Drone arms itself with its Stinger, and enforces the Ship Gate before anything gets committed or pushed.

The application stack this colony serves is SvelteKit with Svelte 5, Payload CMS, Vercel, Neon Postgres with Drizzle, WorkOS auth, Stripe with custom Elements, Doppler for secrets, PostHog for analytics, Sentry for error tracking, Tailscale for private networking, and GoHighLevel for CRM integration. Most of the roster below speaks that stack directly. The rest handles the process around it: documentation, git hygiene, project management, CI, and other platforms a client project might touch (Discord, Slack, Telegram, mobile app stores).

A small number of Drones still carry description or body text from a prior product this repo does not run anymore. They stay in the roster, because an unregistered Drone is a Drone the orchestrator can't find, but they are marked below and logged in full in [`PAIRING-AUDIT.md`](PAIRING-AUDIT.md).

---

## The pairing law

Every Drone pairs with exactly one Stinger: `<base>-wasp-drone` to `<base>-stinger`. No exceptions inside the roster below; every row checks out.

Core has three orchestrator skills without paired Drones. Skill-only capabilities are also allowed when their frontmatter explicitly declares `metadata.hive-tier: standalone`; the validator checks this for every pack. A standalone skill does not claim a specialist Drone exists.

- `pest-controller-suit` (this file, the router)
- `queen-wasp-stinger` (the forge that creates and validates new Drones and Stingers)
- `get-started-stinger` (repository initialization and hardening)

---

## Installed capability prerequisites

Read Core's `plugin-catalog.json` before selecting a specialist. Every component has one plugin owner. Core remains required; Website Audit also requires Browser and App Testing. Full KB Refresh additionally requires Code Audit.

For local installed plugins, run Core's `hooks/resolve-component.py` with the paired skill name. It reads `~/.wasp-nest/installed-plugins.json` and returns the checked installed path. Load that path before dispatch. If no shell is available, inspect the installed capability list and manifests to verify the same prerequisites. Stop a dependent workflow when its owner or prerequisite is missing; do not follow a source-repository link as an installed runtime substitute.

## Roster

For a user asking which capability fits a desired result, use [outcome discovery](guides/outcome-discovery.md). Its packaged shortlist keeps proposed gaps distinct from existing scope and verified installed availability.

171 Drones routed across Core and optional plugins, sorted into domain groups. Website Audit dispatches its separate twenty-Drone engagement. The Domain column is a one-line summary of the Drone's own frontmatter description. Trigger keywords are pulled from that same description, not invented.

### Code audit (`code-audit-tools` plugin)

These Drones serve `/audit-my-code`. The `audit-my-code-stinger` orchestrator dispatches them by tier; route to one directly only for a single-dimension request. All of them are read-only against the audited repository and write to the run workspace defined in `audit-my-code-stinger/references/audit-contract.md`. `kb-refresh-wasp-drone` serves `/kb-refresh` instead and is dispatched by that command directly; it writes documentation, never code.

### Product planning (`product-studio` plugin)

These three Drones run in order under `/product-studio:plan-product`: strategy, then design, then planning, each ending at an owner approval gate. They plan; they never write PRDs, CTRs or application code. New feature ideas that arrive mid-build go to KIPP in the TARS desk instead.

## Dispatch and arming contract

Spawn every Drone at the top level. Do not nest a Drone inside another Drone.

Every dispatch prompt must arm the Drone before it does anything else:

> You are `<drone-name>`. Before doing anything else, read your paired Stinger in full at `<resolved-stinger-path>` and follow it as your operating manual. Then: [scoped task, exact files in scope, definition of done, how the work will be verified].

Resolve `<stinger-name>` from the Paired Stinger column above, or apply the convention directly: `<base>-wasp-drone` to `<base>-stinger`.

For every row, read the catalog owner and resolve the paired skill from that selected plugin. Core owns fourteen specialist pairs; the other routed pairs belong to optional plugins. Never substitute a Core sibling path for an optional skill.

A Drone dispatched without its Stinger armed is a failed dispatch. Terminate it and re-dispatch with the arming line present. Do not let a Drone proceed on partial knowledge of its own procedure.

When a Claude Drone declares `isolation: worktree` and its Cursor projection is used, ask Cursor for an isolated project copy at dispatch before parallel edits. Cursor does not support that frontmatter field; the generated agent prompt cannot create isolation after the agent starts.

---

## Ship Gate

Every development-focused dispatch closes with the same three gates, in this order, no exceptions:

1. `security-stinger`, armed on `security-wasp-drone`, audits the change first. Security fixes can invalidate a QA pass, so security always runs before quality.
2. `quality-stinger`, armed on `quality-wasp-drone`, verifies the implementation against its source plan, after security fixes have landed.
3. The orchestrator itself, not a dispatched Drone, loads `github-repo-health-stinger` directly and runs the repo-health check.

Never run quality before security. If quality already ran out of order for a cycle, do not run it again; flag the ordering violation, let security run and land fixes, then re-run quality.

After all three gates pass, the user reviews the findings and the diff and gives explicit approval before anything is committed or pushed. No Drone and no orchestrator commits or pushes without that approval.

---

## Library packet routing

Use [the Library Packets guide](guides/library-packets-wasp-drone.md) for reader-specific packet production. Keep source authoring with Library/Knowledge and separately scoped competitive work with Competitive Research. The packet owner integrates facts and preserves audience boundaries.

## Multi-Drone orchestration

Real sequences for this stack. Every sequence below closes with the Ship Gate; it isn't repeated in each entry.

### Coordinate parallel workers

1. Load [Harness Integration](../harness-integration-stinger/SKILL.md) for the actual host/capacity and coordination guide. Resolve its `worker-coordination` prerequisite key before loading selected App Primer's existing worker/wave templates and helper.
2. Record the actual tool availability and capacity, including the parent/integrator. Preserve current settings and the user's task-specific authority. Exclusive paths and shared owners must be explicit before dispatch.
3. Refuse overlapping leases or unverified implementation capacity. Shared Draft/disputed contracts block the affected boundary; route exact terms through Contract Writing and Library before treating provider/consumer work as independent.
4. Arm specialists from their selected owners. Review actual output at the applicable cadence, stop stalled/drifting workers, and preserve a concrete handoff. A validator PASS is structural evidence, not launch authority or a native execution receipt.
5. Integrate against the final candidate identity and run the existing Security then Quality then orchestrator Repository Health close-out. User approval remains required for any commit or push.

### Parallel PRD contract handoff

1. `library-wasp-drone` maps proposed PRD scopes and shared boundaries before assigning independent PRD authors.
2. `contract-writing-wasp-drone` reuses or drafts one `CTR` record per shared boundary and asks Mario to accept the exact normative terms. Draft or disputed boundaries block completion of affected PRDs.
3. `library-wasp-drone` gives each PRD author an accepted revision and separate file ownership. Authors write their PRDs in parallel, pin the revision in each affected index or sub-PRD, and verify their acceptance criteria against the shared terms.
4. The relevant engineering Drones later implement against that revision and run the provider and consumer checks named by the contract. Changed terms return to the contract-writing Drone for impact and acceptance before PRDs are repinned.
5. For `/smoke-it` on existing PRDs, repeat the inventory and check every `## Contract dependencies` pin before forming parallel implementation waves. Run the contract Stinger's read-only validator after Library changes links. Put missing, Draft, disputed, or stale boundaries in the execution ledger with the exact decision needed; independent criteria can continue, but the affected provider and consumer work cannot be declared ready or VERIFIED.

### Plan execution loop

1. `pest-controller-suit` selects the narrowest implementation Drone for the approved plan. Use `rust-wasp-drone` for Rust and Cargo work, `tauri-wasp-drone` for the Tauri application boundary, `impeccable-wasp-drone` for frontend design implementation, or the matching domain Drone for other work.
2. The implementation Drone completes the bounded scope and records fresh verification evidence.
3. `security-wasp-drone` audits the completed change first and every medium-or-higher finding is resolved.
4. The implementation owner reruns every affected check after security fixes.
5. `quality-wasp-drone` independently verifies the final implementation against its source plan.
6. The orchestrator loads `github-repo-health-stinger` and completes the repository-health gate.
7. The user reviews the reports and diff before the authorized commit or push.

### Build a website

1. `website-wasp-drone` scaffolds or extends the site from the brief.
2. `svelte-wasp-drone` for SvelteKit/Svelte 5 structure and runes.
3. `tailwind-wasp-drone` for utility and token work.
4. `shadcn-svelte-wasp-drone` for component installs.
5. `seo-aeo-wasp-drone` for metadata, JSON-LD, and Core Web Vitals.
6. Ship Gate.

### Frontend design / UI implementation

1. **`impeccable-wasp-drone`** is the single router for all frontend UI/UX/design implementation, redesign, refinement, new-surface, component, and design-system-capture work. It runs Start -> Iterate -> Polish -> Maintain, including the pre-flight sync check and deterministic `npx impeccable detect <target>` gate.
2. **`design-system-wasp-drone`** and **`ux-ui-svelte-wasp-drone`** own product-specific token, component-library, and accessibility enforcement on established systems. Impeccable makes that enforcement mechanical via DESIGN.md drift rules and the detector gate.
3. **`security-wasp-drone`** then **`quality-wasp-drone`** close out under the Plan execution loop.

### Research an ICP

1. `icp-research-wasp-drone` runs the seed lane from the domain and writes the seed brief.
2. The orchestrator dispatches one `icp-research-wasp-drone` per off-site lane (customers, market, hiring, voice, news, technographic) in parallel from the top level, using the Stinger's lane brief template.
3. One `icp-research-wasp-drone` merges and grades the ledger and writes the dossier.
4. Hand-offs as needed: `competitive-research-wasp-drone`, `cold-outreach-wasp-drone`, `crm-integration-wasp-drone`, `discovery-research-wasp-drone`. Research-only: no Ship Gate unless code changes follow.

### Plan a product

1. The owner runs `/product-studio:plan-product`. `product-strategy-wasp-drone` interviews the owner and writes the Product Strategy. The owner approves it.
2. `product-design-wasp-drone` turns the approved strategy into the UX package and prototypes, scores it with its critique rubric, and offers the Claude Design brief and import. The owner approves it. `design-system-wasp-drone`, `impeccable-wasp-drone` and `ux-ui-wasp-drone` are optional hand-offs.
3. `product-planning-wasp-drone` writes the PRD map, `library/requirements/plans/wave-plan.md`, the project Definition of Done and the handoff packet. The owner approves them.
4. `library-wasp-drone` writes the listed PRDs; `contract-writing-wasp-drone` drafts the listed CTRs, which stay Draft until the owner accepts each exact revision.
5. `/smoke-it` or TARS runs the approved wave plan. Planning is research-only: no Ship Gate unless code changes follow.

### Manage parallel sessions (TARS)

1. The owner runs `/tars` in the Claude Code desktop app, which loads `tars-stinger` into that session. TARS needs the desktop app: a terminal session has no chip or session tools.
2. TARS offers CASE (its read-only adviser) first and KIPP (the owner's feature desk for mid-build ideas) second, arms the 10-minute tick and the 1-minute CI poller, then spawns one small chip per ask; each chip brief names the Drone the chip should arm itself with from this roster. Anything bigger than one small PR goes through a CASE review before chips spawn.
3. Chips do the work under their own Ship Gate; TARS answers their questions, merges green PRs it is allowed to merge, and watches deploys. TARS does no implementation work and never launches a Workflow unless the owner asks.

### Build a node editor

1. `impeccable-wasp-drone` sets the editor's visual language when design work is in scope.
2. `xyflow-wasp-drone` builds the React Flow or Svelte Flow canvas: nodes, edges, handles, connection rules, layout, and flow state.
3. `react-wasp-drone` or `svelte-wasp-drone` owns the surrounding app structure; `db-wasp-drone` owns storage of saved flows.
4. `browser-automation-wasp-drone` adds drag and connect tests when required.
5. Ship Gate.

### Add auth

1. `workos-wasp-drone` wires AuthKit, sessions, and SSO.
2. `security-wasp-drone` audits the implementation (session handling, token storage).
3. `neon-drizzle-wasp-drone` (or `db-wasp-drone` for generic Postgres theory) reviews the users/organizations schema.
4. Ship Gate.

### Take payments

1. `payments-wasp-drone` builds the Stripe Elements checkout and webhook handling.
2. `security-wasp-drone` audits webhook signature verification and secret handling.
3. `neon-drizzle-wasp-drone` reviews the schema that stores customer and subscription state.
4. Ship Gate.

### Ship a release

1. `ci-release-wasp-drone` drives the build and the CI workflows.
2. `changelog-release-notes-wasp-drone` writes the changelog entry and release notes.
3. `github-repo-health-wasp-drone`, or the orchestrator loading `github-repo-health-stinger` directly per the Ship Gate, confirms repo health before tagging.

### Instrument the product

1. `posthog-wasp-drone` wires product analytics, feature flags, or experiments.
2. `sentry-wasp-drone` wires error tracking and performance tracing.
3. Ship Gate.

### Data-layer change

1. `neon-drizzle-wasp-drone` designs or reviews the Drizzle schema and migration.
2. `db-wasp-drone` weighs in when the question is generic Postgres indexing or partitioning theory, not Neon- or Drizzle-specific.
3. `security-wasp-drone` audits tenant isolation and PII handling.
4. Ship Gate.

### Audit a codebase

1. Run `/audit-my-code <tier>`; `audit-my-code-stinger` dispatches the tier's Drones in waves (foundation, bloat, and security in parallel, then quality, then remediation, then the brief).
2. Execute the Mario tier's PRDs with `/smoke-it` and its IRDs with `/pest-controller`.
3. Re-run the same tier to prove the fixes landed.

Add a sequence here whenever a recurring multi-Drone pattern emerges in practice.

## Adding a new Drone

Don't hand-roll a new Drone. Walk [`../queen-wasp-stinger/guides/pest-controller-registration.md`](../queen-wasp-stinger/guides/pest-controller-registration.md), the forge's registration guide, start to finish. It covers naming the pair, writing the agent frontmatter, writing the paired Stinger, and registering both here.

---

**164 Drones routed: 14 in Core and 150 in optional plugins. Website Audit dispatches its 20 additional Drones through its own orchestrator.** Installed Drones have a paired Stinger. See [`PAIRING-AUDIT.md`](PAIRING-AUDIT.md) for the last full pairing audit; the source validator checks the current routed roster against the filesystem.
