# Data and AI Tools

Design data, retrieval, AI runtime, model tooling and agent operations.

Storage, retrieval and AI orchestration form one technical journey. IDE/session tools remain opt-in; TARS retains its Claude-desktop-only prerequisite.

Requires `wasp-nest-core`.

## Start one task

Required packs: `wasp-nest-core`

Install the selected pack and its prerequisites through the marketplace. For the version 3 layout, purge the previous installation first. Select the skill shown by your client, or paste this request with real paths and scope:

After adding the Wasp Nest marketplace, Claude Code uses these installation instructions:

```text
/plugin install wasp-nest-core@wasp-nest
/plugin install data-and-ai-tools@wasp-nest
```

Other clients use their plugin selection UI or discovered skill selector. Installing a package and invoking a task are separate steps.

```text
Use retrieval-stinger to investigate [search path] with [sample queries and expected results]. Identify misses and propose measurable changes.
```

Expected result: A data or AI review tied to the supplied code and evidence. TARS requires Claude Code desktop and its session surface.



Claude Code plugin command names:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/data-and-ai-tools:build-rag-feature` ([procedure](commands/build-rag-feature.md)) | Build a bounded RAG feature against an accepted corpus, access contract, and measured retrieval and answer evaluation. |
| `/data-and-ai-tools:design-data` ([procedure](commands/design-data.md)) | Design a source-grounded data model, access boundaries, indexes and a migration proposal without executing database changes. |
| `/data-and-ai-tools:tars` ([procedure](commands/tars.md)) | Make this Claude Code desktop session TARS, the manager. Spawns chips for what you ask, manages every session to done, fields their questions, uses CASE for proportion and scoped decisions, and KIPP as the Feature Desk, runs a real 10-minute tick and a 1-minute CI watch. |

Codex can use the named skill or its generated `source-command-<name>` wrapper where a source command exists. Home installations may expose flat commands. Use the actual selector offered by the host. A pack with no paired agents runs its standalone skills directly; a skill name does not prove that a native agent was launched.

## Prerequisites and boundaries

- `implement provider/backend adapters` also needs `backend-and-desktop-tools`.
- `feature-margin-economics` also needs `software-economics-tools`.

TARS, CASE and KIPP require Claude Code Desktop. They have no Codex, Cursor or Cowork fallback; those clients cannot start the manager team by loading its files.

Core supplies shared routing and review methods. Native Codex role registration requires the explicit installed-plugin registry and trusted Core hook; a marketplace selection alone is not proof of registration. Read the linked skill before work. Missing source, browser, connector, renderer or account access is a reported gap. Installation does not authorize sending, publishing, paid work or live settings changes.
