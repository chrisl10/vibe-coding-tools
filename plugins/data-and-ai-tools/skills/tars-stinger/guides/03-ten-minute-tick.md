# 03. The 10-minute tick

Runs on every `CronCreate` fire. Derived from `distilled-tars.md` D2, D3, D4. Target: under two minutes of TARS time, then idle.

1. **Read notifications** (`ReadNotifications`) until none remain. Handle any question with `05-questions-and-decisions.md`.
2. **Check CASE and KIPP first.** Verify linked session state, read any pending verdict or feature-card handoff, and record evidence in the ledger. Idle helpers with no pending ask are healthy; do not treat them as stalled work chips, respawn duplicates or archive them. If a helper has a pending assigned question, review actual output and record blockers.
3. **Check every managed work session** in the Sessions table with state `RUNNING` or `BLOCKED`:
   - `list_events(session_id, limit 15)`. Progress means a file changed, a check ran, a commit or PR happened, or a question was sent since the last tick. A session's own "working on it" text is not progress.
   - **Beacon heartbeat (second source, never a replacement for `list_events`):** if the lifecycle beacon hook is installed, read the session's heartbeat (path and id mapping in `references/REFERENCE.md`, State layout). Check `lastProgressAt`, `lastProgressWhat`, `lastEventAt`, and `flags` (`noProgress10`, `noProgress20`, `turnWarn45`, `turnDeadline60`, `pollerStale`). A missing, unresolved, or ended (`ended: true`) heartbeat is skipped silently. `pollerStale` feeds step 4.
   - **When the two sources disagree,** `list_events` decides. If only the beacon shows progress, it may delay a nudge or a stop by one tick, never cancel it: a session with no `list_events` progress for three ticks is stopped. Log every disagreement in the ledger (session, what each source showed).
   - Update "Last real progress" in the ledger.
   - **Waiting on a permission prompt** is not a stall: tell the owner in one line which session is waiting and on what. Never change a session's permission mode to unblock it.
   - **No progress for one tick (10 minutes):** send one message: what you see, the one next step you expect, and "reply with a blocker if there is one". Use `notify_when_idle: true`.
   - **No progress for two ticks (20 minutes):** first apply the beacon exception above. If the beacon shows progress since the last tick, keep the session running one more tick and log the disagreement in the ledger now; stop it at the third tick without `list_events` progress. Otherwise `stop_session`, then decide: re-brief the same session with a narrower task, or offer a smaller replacement chip and archive the old one once the owner agrees. Record which.
   - **Offered chips:** `list_sessions` (family first, then exact title). Link any that started, as in `02-spawn-and-track-chips.md` step 5 (record the `local_...` id, state `RUNNING`), and check them from the next tick on. Remind the owner in one line about any still not started after two ticks.
4. **Run the CI watchdog** (`04-ci-watch.md`, Watchdog): heartbeat age, Monitor alive, `get_status` per session with a PR, `gh run list` per watched branch. Anything the poller missed is handled now and noted as a poller miss.
5. **Timers:** `CronList` must show the tick. If the 7-day expiry is within a day, recreate it and record the new id.
6. **Append one ledger line**: sessions running, blocked, done; CI state; any decision.
7. **Report to the owner only if something changed** that they would act on. Otherwise stay silent and go idle.
